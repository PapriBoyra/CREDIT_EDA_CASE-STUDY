#Credit EDA Case Study

##Overview
This project explores consumer and loan data to identify trends and factors influencing loan defaults. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, the study provides insights that can help improve credit risk management.

##Features
--Data Cleaning: Managing missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
--Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing trends and relationships between key attributes such as debt-to-income ratio, income levels, and loan defaults.
--Visualization: Using charts and graphs to represent data insights visually.
--Actionable Insights: Offering recommendations based on analysis results.

##Technologies Used
-**Python**
-**Pandas:** Data manipulation and exploration.
-**NumPy:** Numerical computations.
-**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
-**Google colab:** Interactive coding environment.

##Dataset
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H0aUNbR_v9bGAPBzVEQ6oHCRdtiMdLTS?usp=sharing

--The dataset includes the following key features:
--Loan Amount: Amount borrowed by the consumer.
--Income Level: Annual income of the borrower.
--Debt-to-Income Ratio: Ratio of monthly debt payments to monthly income.
--Credit History: Information on the borrowerâ€™s credit performance.
--Loan Default: Indicator of whether the loan was defaulted.

##Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
--Python 3.7 or later.
--Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

##Installation

Clone the repository:

~git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-eda-case-study.git
cd credit-eda-case-study~

##Install dependencies:

--pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
--Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:
--google colab Credit_EDA.ipynb

##Key Insights
-**Debt-to-Income Ratios:** Higher ratios are associated with increased defaults.
-**Credit History:** Borrowers with shorter credit histories are at greater risk of defaulting.
-**Income Levels:** Lower income levels correspond to higher default rates.

##Recommendations

Tighten lending policies for borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios.
Promote the development of strong credit histories among borrowers.
Design flexible repayment plans for high-risk customers.

##Future Enhancements

--Integrate predictive machine learning models to assess default probabilities.
--Conduct regional and demographic-specific analysis.
--Incorporate time-series data to analyze trends over time.
